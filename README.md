## Overview

The Ambition Scripting API Library is a template-library designed specifically for integration with Ambition Client.
It serves as an API interface for generating scripting bindings and json documentation, facilitating scripting capabilities.

## Purpose

This library-template is intended to be used as a resource for learning and experimentation with scripting in general, you may use this in your own project as-is however, (not recommended) if it benefits you.
By providing access to scripting bindings and automatically generated json documentation, developers can create dynamic, and modern scripting systems and documentation.

## Key Features

- **Scripting Bindings Generation**: Automatically generate scripting bindings to supply to the scripting engine.
- **Json Documentation Generation**: Generate detailed json documentation for the scripting API, simplifying the process of understanding available functions, parameters, and return types.
