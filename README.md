## Overview

The Ambition Scripting API Library is a template-library designed specifically for integration with Ambition Client.
It serves as an API interface for generating scripting bindings and json documentation, facilitating scripting capabilities.

## Purpose

This library is intended to be used as a resource for learning and experimentation with scripting in general, you may use this in your own project as-is (pre existing binding-templates).
However this is not recommended and we would prefer you make it unique to your own api, and simply use the pre existing bindings, as a reference instead.

## Key Features

By providing access to these key features, developers can create dynamic, and modern scripting systems and auto-updated documentation.
- **Bindings Generation**: Automatically generate script bindings to supply to the scripting engine for evaluation.
- **Json Generation**: Generate detailed json documentation for the scripting API, simplifying the process of understanding available functions, parameters, and return types.
- **Structure** The api structure is kept as user-friendly and allows making user-friendly scripting apis, much more accomplishable.
